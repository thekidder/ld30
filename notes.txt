Static Charge
You are a single pixel, navigating a featureless field of static. 

Unresolved questions
- what is the gameplay in the static dimension? What creates difficulty?
  - Are these (invisible?) obstacles?
  - Is there are restriction on movement?
  - Are there enemies or traps to avoid?
  - Do the underlying level structures move or change?

- what are the connected worlds?
  - You play as a pixel trapped in the snow of an analog display. or alternatively, as a single bit of information navigating a digital field of noise. 
  - there could be a second layer, representing the underlying logic or structure behind the noise. by navigating this, you can clear the noise and win.
  - maybe it's something a bit more nuanced?
