Static Charge
You are a single pixel, navigating a featureless field of static. 

Unresolved questions
- what is the gameplay in the static dimension? What creates difficulty?
  - Are these (invisible?) obstacles?
  - Is there are restriction on movement?
  - Are there enemies or traps to avoid?
  - Do the underlying level structures move or change?

- what are the connected worlds?
  - You play as a pixel trapped in the snow of an analog display. or alternatively, as a single bit of information navigating a digital field of noise. 
  - there could be a second layer, representing the underlying logic or structure behind the noise. by navigating this, you can clear the noise and win.
  - maybe it's something a bit more nuanced?


SPEC
- you are a pixel, moving discretely across a field of noise
- the noise affects your character. the more noise around you, the fainter you get. this is a life meter, of sorts
- the goal is to get rid of the noise. you can only do this from the underlying dimension, which consists of structures that generate the noise. 

- what sorts of structures?
  - beacons - or towers - that are noise generating - or noise modulating? you need to find them and deactivate them

- i'd rather not the structured world simply be a layer under the noise world - seems too straightforwad. 

- what other kinds of structures would generate a space-varying noise?

- maybe the beacons emit different patterns - pulses of noise, or different spatial patterns. these happen on different frequencies, so navigation is not particularly trivial 

- maybe you can place your own beacons or bombs that create/destroy/modulate noise? so-called "static charges"

- you should need to do something in the static world that affects the underlying world. 

- there are walls/obstacles in the structure world - the challenge is to move such that you avoid the static waves and also navigate the underlying world

- static charges - can temporarily destroy walls as well as static? maybe in different patterns
